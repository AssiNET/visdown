> “The purpose of visualisation is insight, not pictures.”
-- Ben Shniederman

---

# Intent

1. Learn how visualisation is both a **science** and an **art**
2. Pivot from a charting to a **grammar-based** approach
3. Create **interactive visualisation** as narratives or dashboards

---

# Approach

1. Learn from _**first principles**_
2. Master a _**tool-agnostic**_ approach
3. Focus on creating visualisation _**through exercises**_

---

# Journey

1. Paper and Pen exercise (15 mins)
2. The Grammar of Interactive Graphics (30 mins)
3. Static visualisation (45 mins)
    - Single-view 
    - Multi-view (Layering & Compositions)
4. Interactive visualisation (90 mins)
    - Interaction patterns
    - Narratives and Dashboards

# Paper and Pen Exercise

# EXERCISE: Create 10 visualisations for this dataset

area      |    sales      |   profit     |
:----------|  -----------: | -----------: |
North      |        5      |      2       |
East       |       25      |      8       |
West       |       15      |      6       |
South      |       20      |      5       |
Central    |       10      |      3       |

## The Grammar of Interactive Graphics

- Data Layer
- Visual Layer
- Annotation Layer
- Interaction Layer

---

Give an example to build this up.

---

# Data Layer
**Types**
- Categorical: Nominal, Ordinal
- Continuous: Temporal, Quantiative

**Transformations**
- Tall <-> Wide
- Aggregation (Bins)
- Basic Stats (Min, Max, Average)
- New Variables - Geocoding
- Filtering, Refining

---

# Visual Representation
- Marks: Points, Tick, Lines, Bar, Area, Glyphs
- Aesthetics: Size, Color, Shape
- Coordinate: Cartesian, Polar, Geographic, Parellel
- Layout: Single, Row-Wise, Column-Wise, **Multi-Chart**

---

# Annotations
- Labels: X, Y
- Title
- Axis and Tick marks
- Legends
- **Story Elements**

---

# Interaction
- Annotation: on hover
- Highlighting

---

# **Data Types e.g. Temperature**

- **Categorical** 
    - *Nominal*: Burned, Not Burned
    - *Ordinal*: Hot, Warm, Cold
- **Continuous**
    - *Interval*: 30 °C, 40 °C, 80 °C 
    - *Ratio*: 30 K, 40 K, 50 K 

---

# **Data Types - Operations**

- **Categorical** 
  - *Nominal*: = , !=
  - *Ordinal*: =, !=, >, <
- **Continuous**
  - *Interval*: =, !=, >, <, -, % of diff 
  - *Ratio*: =, !=, >, <, -, +, %

# Types of Questions

- Descriptive: What are the average delays in London Airport
    - By airport
    - By airline
    - By destination
- Inquisitive: Has flight delays being increasing?
    - By airport
    - By airline
    - By destination
- Predictive: Plan a vacation to NYC
    - Which airport should I leave from?
    - Which airline should I book on?

# Data

## London Punctuality Dataset

source, country, destination, airline, type: nominal
flights, delay* : quantiative
year: temporal

Source: Where is the data from?
